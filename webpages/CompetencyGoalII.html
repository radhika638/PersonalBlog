                    I use a variety of developmentally appropriate equipment to promote the physical development of all children.
                    I have my room setting for Young Infants in such a way that they have ample space to move, roll and sit up. I
                    have playmats big enough to support them when they want to push themselves up and soft enough to avoid head
                    injuries when they roll or move. I have my schedule set in such a way that children have enough time so 
                    they can practice and develop their physical skills such as crawling, sitting, standing, walking and 
                    running indoors and outdoors.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    I use a variety of developmentally appropriate learning experiences and teaching strategies to promote 
                    curiosity, reasoning and problem solving and to lay a foundation for all later learning. I include going 
                    outside of the classroom on a buggy ride as a part of their daily learning activities where there is plenty 
                    of opportunity for them to see and explore their surroundings. I tell them what they are going to explore if
                    any new opportunity pops up such as passing by a school bus or a firetruck. I iterate the most popular 
                    object names on the way such as doors, windows, school bus, trash can, nearby store names so they can 
                    identify when they see one.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I provide a variety of colorful and interesting books, both paper and cloth in my room that are age 
                    appropriate. The books are arranged on a shelf that is reachable to Mobile Infants. I set my curriculum
                    for the week with books that I am about to read to the children, and I follow accordingly. I include songs
                    in the play time that are age appropriate, and I play them every day. I encourage them to sing along to 
                    help them develop their communication, listening and learning skills.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I use a variety of developmentally appropriate tools with the children that express their individual creative
                    abilities. I include free hand art as an activity with the children where we all sit together at a table 
                    and draw pictures of the day. If the theme for the week is to explore the letter E, we draw pictures of 
                    objects that start with letter E such as Egg, Elephant, Eye, Ear etc.
