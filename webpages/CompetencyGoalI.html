                    I provide a safe environment and teach children safe practices to prevent and reduce injuries by setting 
                    the room free of rolling toys that may cause injuries to both children and adults/teachers by stepping on 
                    those and tripping. Babies at age below 18 months donâ€™t really know how to put the toy back after playing 
                    with it and so they leave them as is. It is our responsibility as adults to pick those up after them, 
                    especially when they play with the stacking toys. Stacking toys are those with varying sizes and the 
                    smaller the toy gets, the more hazardous they become. 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    I provide an environment that promotes health and prevents illness by picking up the toys they played with 
                    and securing them in dirty toys bin securely. I sanitize the toys they played with soap and bleach solution 
                    at the end of the day or when time permits. Sanitizing toys every day is the most important task for the day 
                    as most of the babies put the toys in their mouth as that helps them with their teeth. By sanitizing those 
                    toys at the end of day, it helps them from getting sick by using them the next day. Not only the toys they 
                    played with, I also sanitize the surfaces they played on, the glass doors and windows they touch, the sheets
                    they nap on and the high chairs they sit on to eat.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I organize the physical spaces in such a way that they are secure, safe and at approachable distance to the 
                    babies when crisis arises. Areas such as dropping zone, play area, reading area, dining area, changing area 
                    and napping area separated from each other and at the same time not very distant from each other. I organize
                    my weekly planned materials, daily schedules and routines in such a way that they are interesting and 
                    enjoyable and that promotes engagement, play, exploration and learning for all the babies.

                <p>
                    My room design is appropriate for optimum learning. I set up spaces with clear labels with pictures of how 
                    they are supposed to look. I make sure I have lots of materials so that I can change them out often to keep
                    the children interested in learning. I provide age-appropriate tables and chairs. I have a wonderful library
                    center that has soft comfortable seating with interesting books. I provide other centers such as home 
                    centers that help children learn social and communication skills, a play center with structure to keep 
                    them active and focused all the time and a writing center to scribble on their ideas. I change out the 
                    materials in these centers every month to encourage and excel the greatest growth and development for my 
                    young children.

                    My lesson plans reflect my organizational skills. I am dedicated to teaching interesting and age-appropriate 
                    materials. Repeating words, a concept or a skill allows the children to form an understanding and even try to
                    imitate it. Children may repeat unfamiliar words back to me as they learn them, and they will learn letters 
                    and words by repeatedly seeing them written down. Repetition helps us remember embedded information in our 
                    long-term memory. Hence, I use my themes to ensure repetition in whatever I am teaching. I repeat a few of 
                    the popular activities on a weekly basis which help them learn from those. Our school lets children 
                    participate in holiday activities such as Easter, Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas, Diwali etc., so they
                    do not lose their holiday spirit.

                    Our school lets the parents provide us with extensive information on the way their baby eats. They provide us
                    with the formula/milk, information on the amounts they eat and the times they eat at. If the baby likes or
                    dislikes the food, we let the parents know so they are aware of what their baby ate for the day and plan 
                    accordingly for the next day.
