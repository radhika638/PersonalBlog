                    Young children learn better using Sign language. When it comes to young babies, who are newly learning their surroundings,
                    most of the time it gets difficult to let others know what they are feeling or what their thought process is. They tend to
                    outburst for every feeling (like hunger, sleep, sickness or sometimes poop in diapers). I have noticed in my personal 
                    experience that a child using sign language communicates better about their feelings.

                <p>
                    I have noticed that the best place to observe if the baby is communicating enough is when they are eating. We would know 
                    how they are telling us that they are hungry, or they want more of their servings or they are done. I have always found 
                    the idea of teaching babies how to use their hands to communicate very fascinating. I believe my role is to teach them 
                    how to communicate in a better fashion.

                    In my personal experience, I learned that babies learn mostly by imitating their teachers. When they see their teacher 
                    using the same actions repeatedly, they tend to communicate in the same manner. When a child tries to push up themselves
                    to stand, we tend to clap and cheer them. Eventually, when they stand up by themselves, the child knows that he did 
                    something that makes their teacher cheerful and claps all by himself. The child may feel shy to show off in their 
                    room, but most of them tend to show in front of their parents and in their family.
